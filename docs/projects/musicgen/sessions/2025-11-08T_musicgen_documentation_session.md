# Session Log: 2025-11-08 - Musicgen Documentation

## Task: MG-007 - Document Musicgen Setup and Usage

### Objective:
Write comprehensive documentation for setting up and using the Musicgen module.

### Steps Taken:

1.  **Created `USAGE.md`:**
    *   Created `/Users/davidcaballero/mlx-RAG/docs/projects/musicgen/USAGE.md`. This file provides detailed instructions on:
        *   Model weight acquisition (simulated process).
        *   Command-line interface (CLI) usage with `generate_music.py` and example commands.
        *   Programmatic usage with the `MusicgenAdapter`.
        *   Important considerations like hardware requirements and dependencies.

2.  **Updated `README.md`:**
    *   Modified `/Users/davidcaballero/mlx-RAG/docs/projects/musicgen/README.md` to include a new "Documentation" section with a link to `USAGE.md`.

### Next Steps:

1.  **Update `tasks.md`:** Mark MG-007 as completed and move it to the "Done" section.
2.  **Review Project Status:** All initial tasks for the Musicgen project have been completed. I will now review the overall status and await further instructions.
