# Session Log Template

Use this template to document each working session **before committing**. Duplicate the structure below, fill in every field, and save the entry alongside your work (e.g., `docs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-session.md`). Keep language concise and candid—this log is meant to surface decisions, errors, and insights for future contributors.

## Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-07`
- **Start Time**: `11:15` (local time)
- **End Time**: `12:00`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `00:45`
- **Working Title**: `MLX Data Pipeline Project Creation and Documentation`
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `N/A`

## Objectives
- Primary goal(s) for this session:
  - Create a new project `mlx-data-pipeline` for generic data ingestion and processing.
  - Populate all core documentation files for the new project.
  - Research MLX data handling best practices and `mlx.data`.

## Execution Notes
- Entry point (files, scripts, commands):
  - Used `cp -R` to duplicate `docs/templates/project-template` to `docs/projects/mlx-data-pipeline`.
  - Used `google_web_search` to research MLX data pipeline best practices.
  - Used `write_file` to populate `README.md`, `SITEMAP.md`, `AUDIT-log.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and `tasks.md` in the new project directory.
  - Used `write_file` to create this session log.
- Key changes made:
  - New project `mlx-data-pipeline` created with a complete set of documentation.
  - Documentation reflects MLX data handling best practices, `mlx.data` usage, and generic data pipeline principles.
  - This session log created.
- Tests / commands executed:
  - `cp -R`
  - `google_web_search`
  - `write_file`

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**:
  - None.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Decided to create a dedicated project for the MLX data pipeline to centralize data handling for all MLX projects within the monorepo.
  - Emphasized modularity and `mlx.data` for efficiency and extensibility.
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - `mlx.data` is a powerful, framework-agnostic library for high-throughput data loading.
  - The importance of `prefetch` and careful handling of the Python GIL for performance.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - Update the `mlx-setup` session log to include the creation of this new project.
  - Begin implementing the tasks outlined in `docs/projects/mlx-data-pipeline/tasks.md`.
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - None.

## Session Quote
- *Famous quote that captured the tone of the session*:  
  > “Data is the new oil.” — *Clive Humby*

## Post Image Prompt
- Use the following prompt to generate an illustrative image for the post/session recap:  
  ```
  A stylized data pipeline with various data sources (documents, structured data) flowing into MLX processing units, with a focus on efficiency and modularity, in a clean, technical style.
  ```
