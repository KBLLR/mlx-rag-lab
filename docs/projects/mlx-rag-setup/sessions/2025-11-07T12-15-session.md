# Session Log Template

Use this template to document each working session **before committing**. Duplicate the structure below, fill in every field, and save the entry alongside your work (e.g., `docs/sessions/YYYY--DD-session.md`). Keep language concise and candid—this log is meant to surface decisions, errors, and insights for future contributors.

## Session Summary
- **Date**: `2025-11-07`
- **Start Time**: `12:15` (local time)
- **End Time**: `12:30`
- **Elapsed (HH:MM)**: `00:15`
- **Working Title**: `Planning RAG Pipeline Performance Analysis`
- **Associated Tasks / Issues**: `RAG-011`

## Objectives
- Primary goal(s) for this session:
  - Formulate a plan to analyze the RAG pipeline's performance, focusing on retrieval accuracy and latency.
  - Review existing ingestion and retrieval code.
  - Create a new task for this work.

## Execution Notes
- Entry point (files, scripts, commands):
  - Reviewed `docs/projects/mlx-rag-setup/tasks.md`.
  - Read `src/rag/ingestion/create_vdb.py`, `src/rag/retrieval/query_vdb.py`, and `src/rag/retrieval/vdb.py`.
  - Used `replace` to add a new task to `tasks.md`.
  - Used `write_file` to create this session log.
- Key changes made:
  - A clear plan for benchmarking the RAG pipeline has been established.
  - A new task (RAG-011) has been created to track this work.
- Tests / commands executed:
  - `read_many_files`
  - `replace`
  - `write_file`

## Reflection
- **Errors Encountered**:
  - None.
- **Decisions Taken**:
  - Decided to create a dedicated benchmarking script to ensure systematic and reproducible performance measurements.
  - Decided to use a small, ground-truth dataset for initial accuracy testing.
- **Learnings & Surprises**:
  - The existing RAG pipeline code is straightforward, making it easy to isolate components for benchmarking.

## Next Actions
- Immediate follow-ups:
  - Create the ground-truth dataset (source documents and question-answer pairs).
  - Implement the `benchmark.py` script.
- Blockers / dependencies:
  - None.

## Session Quote
- *Famous quote that captured the tone of the session*:  
  > “What gets measured gets improved.” — *Peter Drucker*

## Post Image Prompt
- Use the following prompt to generate an illustrative image for the post/session recap:  
  ```
