# Repo Hygiene Project - Gemini AI Assistant Guide

This `GEMINI.md` file provides essential context for AI assistant interactions within the Repo Hygiene project. It outlines the project's purpose and directs the AI to more detailed documentation.

## Project Overview

The Repo Hygiene project template is designed to establish and maintain best practices for public repositories. Its main features include defining and enforcing standards for licensing, documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, CHANGELOG), code management (CODEOWNERS, GITIGNORE, CODESTYLE, TESTING), and sensitive data handling (SECRETS, DATA, LOCALDEV). The overall architecture focuses on creating a robust and transparent framework for open-source projects.
